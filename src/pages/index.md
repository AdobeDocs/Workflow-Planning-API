# Planning API

The Adobe Planning APIs allow you to directly call Adobe's servers to perform actions on your Planning data.

## Overview

This documentation provides instructions for Planning APIs.

Planning APIs include REST, SOAP, JavaScript, and User Management APIs, plus code for working with mobile devices and email templates.

The REST API allows for remote execution of many of the system's capabilities. From creating programs to bulk lead import, there are a large number of options that allow fine-grained control of a Planning instance.
